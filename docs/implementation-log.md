# Implementation Log

Date: July 8, 2026

## Source Understanding

- Read the 21-page Universal AI Executive Kernel architecture report from `/Users/sidhantmishra/Downloads/Universal_AI_Executive_Kernel_Report.pdf`.
- Rendered the report into PNG pages under `tmp/pdfs/` for visual inspection.
- Confirmed the report's core planes: host/adapters, ingestion/context intelligence, adaptive orchestration, quality/repair, product delivery, and artifact store.

## Repository Baseline

- Workspace started as an empty Git repository on `main` with no commits.
- Built a Python-first product scaffold from scratch.

## Landmarks Completed

- Added product requirements, implementation plan, architecture, configuration, testing, and implementation log documentation.
- Added Pydantic v2 data models for all major kernel objects.
- Added deterministic ingestion for prompts, files, folders/repos, PDFs, URLs, and binary metadata.
- Added security scanning and redaction for context summaries.
- Added context card creation, ranking, and context packs.
- Added product contract compiler and definition-of-done gates.
- Added planner ensemble v1 and typed DAG validation.
- Added provider registry and adaptive router.
- Added deterministic executor.
- Added quality gate engine.
- Added artifact store and run manifest generation.
- Added standard-library CLI.
- Added optional FastAPI daemon surface.
- Added unit tests.

Latest observed test result:

```text
Ran 6 tests
OK
```

Latest self-run package:

```

Quality result:

- Passed: true.
- Artifact integrity: pass.
- Degraded deterministic routing was explicitly reported for strategic/synthesis tasks because hosted providers are not configured.
